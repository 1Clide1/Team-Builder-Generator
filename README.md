## Description
  
This project lets you generate a team after a series of questions you answer in your terminal. The team is then represented in an html template that shows off their name, email, etc as a nicely presented card. I tried to give the cards more of a name tag type of look that employers usually have. However you can see the result screenshot above!

## Credits
  
Man this project definetly was tough! I tried to use as much as I could from the readme generator project to help me out with this project, but honestly I want to shoutout the previous recordings we get to rewatch for class because I felt like these were honestly the most helpful. Another really helpful resource was stack overflow to help me find a regex for the numbers and that was really helpful to get since I am still unsure on the methods to create my own. Other than that I did run into an issue on saving my work to a seperate folder. I probably accidentally skipped through a step in that process however I was stumpted on that. I felt like I had the idea down just not the execution. I decided to leave that work in the project because eventually it will click and I can just remake that feature in the future. Overall I am really pleased on how this project turned out. It was a lot of hard work that in my opinion paid off in the long run because now I have this cool app to show off!
